        <h2>We live by one value: STUDENTS @ THE CORE</h2>
        <p>

          At CareerTrackers, we work to create meaningful career pathways aligned to our students passion. Our purpose is to Create Opportunities That Inspire Excellence, which is about developing our students into future industry and community leaders so they can become the role models for future generations of Indigenous students. We believe that by creating a strong community of role models we will see more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders gain a degree at university and pursue their career passion.<br><br>

          Since our inception in 2009 we have grown significantly, and the journey has only just begun. Our offices are based in central locations in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. Together, our Intern Advisors are working with 1,138 students, 86 employment partners and 37 different universities.<br><br>

          Our role is to support our students to excel in our three pillars; University, their internship and in our community. Our main goal is to support students to graduate from university and obtain an opportunity to enter graduate employment which we are currently achieving at an 89% success rate.<br><br>

          If you are passionate about creating meaningful career pathways for students and want to play a key role in developing the next generation of Indigenous leaders, working at CareerTrackers could be for for you!
